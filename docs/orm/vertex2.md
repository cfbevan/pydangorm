Certainly. Let's create the documentation for the `vertex.py` module in a developer-friendly format.

## Vertex Module Documentation

### Introduction

The `vertex.py` module is integral to the `pydango` ORM, providing foundational classes and utilities for representing
and working with vertices in ArangoDB.

### Classes

#### 1. VertexCollectionConfig

- **Description**: Configuration specific to a vertex collection in ArangoDB.
- **Attributes**:
  - `type`: Set to `CollectionType.NODE`, this attribute classifies the collection as a node or vertex collection in
    ArangoDB.

#### 2. VertexMeta (Metaclass)

- **Description**: A custom metaclass for vertex models. It processes namespace information, defines relationships
  between vertices, and sets up edge models during the class creation process.

- **Methods**:

  - `_build_edge_to_field_mapping(relationships: Relationships) -> EdgeFieldMapping`:

    - **Purpose**: Constructs a mapping between edges and fields based on provided relationships.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `relationships`: Relationship information between vertices.

  - `_validate_edges(edge_to_field_mapping: EdgeFieldMapping, namespace: dict) -> None`:

    - **Purpose**: Validates the constructed edge-to-field mappings.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `edge_to_field_mapping`: Mapping between edges and fields.
      - `namespace`: Current namespace of the class being processed.

  - `_build_model(relationships: Relationships, name: str) -> Model`:

    - **Purpose**: Constructs a model based on provided relationships and name.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `relationships`: Relationship information between vertices.
      - `name`: Name for the constructed model.

#### 3. VertexModel

- **Description**: Represents a vertex model in the ORM. It defines and manages vertices and their relationships to
  edges.

- **Attributes**:

  - `edges`: Represents the edges related to this vertex.
  - `__edge_to_field_mapping__`: A dictionary mapping edges to their respective fields.

- **Methods**:

  - `__init__(self, **data: Any) -> None`:

    - **Purpose**: Initializes the vertex model.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `data`: Data to initialize the vertex model with.

  - `dict(self, ...) -> dict`:

    - **Purpose**: Extracts the data from the model in a dictionary format.
    - **Parameters**:
      - Various parameters to customize the output, such as `include`, `exclude`, `by_alias`, etc.

### Tips for Developers:

1. When defining a vertex model, extend the `VertexModel` class. Use the provided utilities and methods to ensure proper
   relationships and data handling.
1. The `VertexMeta` metaclass processes and sets up relationships during class creation. Ensure that relationships are
   defined correctly to leverage the ORM's capabilities.
1. Utilize the `VertexModel`'s `dict` method for data extraction and serialization.
